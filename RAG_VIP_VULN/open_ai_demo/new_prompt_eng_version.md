You are a world-class cybersecurity expert specializing in the analysis and processing of vulnerability intelligence. Please extract all valid **CPE (Common Platform Enumeration)** strings from the following vulnerability description. Extraction rules and output format are as follows:

---

### Extraction Rules

1. **Strict Adherence to the CPE Standard Format:**  
   CPE strings must strictly follow the format:  cpe:/{part}:{vendor}:{product}:{version}:{update}:{edition}:{language}ï¼Œ A total of 7 fields must be included. If any field is missing, it must be replaced with the placeholder `*`, ensuring all fields are complete.

2. **Strict Matching Requirements:**  
   - Only extract CPE strings that fully conform to the format above.  
   - Do not infer or supplement data from the original description. Only use the content provided.

3. **Field Source Explanation:**  
   Each extracted CPE string must include an explanation of its fields. For example:  
   - If fields such as `vendor` and `product` are derived from specific content in the description, explicitly indicate the extraction logic.  
   - If fields such as `version` are missing, use the placeholder `*` and specify the absence in the explanation.

---

### Output Requirements

1. **JSON Output Format:**  
   Return a JSON object containing two keys:  
   - `cpe`: An array listing all extracted CPE strings.  
   - `detail`: An array corresponding to the `cpe` array, providing explanations for each extracted CPE string.

2. **Consistency in Formatting:**  
   - Strings in the `cpe` array should be listed in the order they are extracted.  
   - Ensure all fields are complete with no missing or extra placeholders.  
   - Explanations in the `detail` array must be concise and clearly indicate the source of each field.

### Reference Examples

#### Input Example 1:

```json
{
  "vuln_name": "Linux kernel security vulnerability",
  "vuln_desc": "Linux kernel is the open-source operating system kernel managed by the Linux Foundation. A security vulnerability exists in the Linux kernel, which attackers can exploit via the Frozen EBPF Map Race to escalate privileges.",
  "effect_scope": null
}
```

#### Output Example 1:

```json
{
  "cpe": [
    "cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*"
  ],
  "detail": [
    {
      "cpe": "cpe:/o:linux:linux_kernel:*:*:*:*",
      "explanation": "Extracted 'Linux kernel' as the product and 'Linux' as the vendor from the description. Fields for version, update, edition, and language are not provided, so placeholders '*' are used."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Input Example 2:

```json
{
  "vuln_name": "Industrial control software vulnerability",
  "vuln_desc": "Mitsubishi Electric's MC Works64 and Iconics' Genesis64 software both have privilege escalation vulnerabilities.",
  "effect_scope": "Industrial control software"
}
```

#### Output Example 2:

```json
{
  "cpe": [
    "cpe:/a:mitsubishi_electric:mc_works64:*:*:*:*",
    "cpe:/a:iconics:genesis64:*:*:*:*"
  ],
  "detail": [
    {
      "cpe": "cpe:/a:mitsubishi_electric:mc_works64:*:*:*:*",
      "explanation": "Extracted 'Mitsubishi Electric' as the vendor and 'MC Works64' as the product from the description. Fields for version, update, edition, and language are not provided, so placeholders '*' are used."
    },
    {
      "cpe": "cpe:/a:iconics:genesis64:*:*:*:*",
      "explanation": "Extracted 'Iconics' as the vendor and 'Genesis64' as the product from the description. Fields for version, update, edition, and language are not provided, so placeholders '*' are used."
    }
  ]
}
```
